# Einblicke Server

This a personal project of mine which lets you send your favourite moments right to your loved ones' e-ink picture frames. 


It is fully coded in Dart/Flutter and consists of 3 repositories:
- einblicke_app
- einblicke_server
- einblicke_frame (coming soon..)

The hardware I'm using:
- Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W
- Waveshare EPD7in3f E-Ink display + SPI module
- 3D printed frame (coming soon..)

At the moment, the app and server only need some minor refactoring to be ready for v0.1 but a proper app for the frame is yet to be coded.
